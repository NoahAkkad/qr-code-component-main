## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

For me, it was very easy because of dealing with Flexbox. I hope to learn JavaScript quickly in order to make a QR generator.


```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh
}
```

### Continued development

I will try to complete all the challenges and learn JavaScript
